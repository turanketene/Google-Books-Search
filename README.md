# Google-Books-Search

## Overview
For this application, we have created a React-based Google Books Search app. This website was made functional by utilizing React components, helper/util functions, and  React lifecycle methods to query and display books based on user searches.  Node, Express and MongoDB were also used so that users can save books to review or purchase later.
